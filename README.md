*Case Studies in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (CSCN8040)*  

##  Project Overview  
Hydrogen fuel-cell tests usually run for a fixed full cycle, even when the stack begins to degrade early. This leads to unnecessary time loss, wasted hydrogen, and avoidable stress on the system.

This project builds an **AI/ML-driven early-stopping mechanism** that detects drift and failure onset in real time. Using simulated fuel-cell sensor data, the system identifies the earliest safe stopping point without compromising diagnostic accuracy.

##  Problem Statement  
Traditional fuel-cell test cycles continue running until completion, regardless of early degradation signals. The objective is to create a data-driven model that predicts drift, detects failure onset, and **terminates the test early**, reducing runtime while maintaining output quality.

##  Dataset & Experimentation  
We generated a synthetic dataset that replicates real fuel-cell behavior:

- Stable → Drift → Failure phases  
- Four sensors: voltage, temperature, pressure, current  
- 100 runs (300 min each)  
- Labeled drift and failure onset for supervised learning  
- Data validation included missing-value checks, duplicate detection, range verification, and index consistency tests

A **two-sample t-test** confirmed that early-stopped tests produce statistically similar results to full-duration tests (p < 0.05).

##  AIML Methodology  
The Early-Stop Intelligence System (ESIS) consists of:

- Feature Engineering: rolling statistics & gradient patterns  
- Anomaly Detection Model: RandomForest / Gradient Boosted Trees  
- Threshold Logic: converts anomaly probability into STOP/CONTINUE decisions  
- Real-Time Trigger: halts the cycle at drift/failure onset  

The model demonstrated >99% accuracy in classifying normal vs drift/failure states.

##  Key Outcomes  
- 50% reduction in testing time  
- No performance loss compared to full tests  
- Consistent detection of drift and failure onset  
- A functional prototype of a real-time safety and efficiency tool  

##  Final Product Description  
The final deliverable is a **real-time Early-Stopping AI Controller** for hydrogen fuel-cell benches. It monitors live sensor streams, predicts early-stage degradation, and automatically ends the test when unsafe conditions emerge.

Benefits include increased throughput, reduced hydrogen consumption, lower operational cost, improved testbench safety, and a predictive adaptive testing workflow.
